## Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository has been created by Abhinav Khandelwal for submitting a project on Getting and Cleaning Data
provided by John Hopkins University on Coursera. The project is to merge various tables, then clean and make tidy data set.

This repository is the brief introduction about the files which are stored in the repository.

codebook.md - It is a file which explains about the variables,data and changes which I have created in the scripting.

run.analysis.R - This is the file which contains the script for getting and cleaning the data and performed below 5 steps in achieving the                   tidy_data.
                -Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
                -Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
                -Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
                -Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
                -From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity                 and each subject.
                
tidy_data.txt - After running the script this is the final tidy data i got.
